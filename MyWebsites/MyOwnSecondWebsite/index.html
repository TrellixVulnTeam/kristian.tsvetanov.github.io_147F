                <h3>What exactly is Front-End ?</h3>
                <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with
                    front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

                <h3>Distinguishing frontend from backend</h3>
                <p>“Backend” refers to everything users of a software or website cannot see. This includes, for example, servers that host websites. A database that stores user input data or website content can also be assigned to the back end. In case of
                    a website, the internet connects frontend and backend.</p>

                <h3>What makes an SEO-friendly frontend?</h3>
                <p>Users who can easily navigate through a website tend to stay longer and rarely abort their visit. This is important for the ranking of your website because dwell times and bounce rates are important evaluation criteria for Google. Below
                    we explain a few factors that contribute to an SEO-friendly frontend and thus influence your website’s usability and ranking on Google.</p>
